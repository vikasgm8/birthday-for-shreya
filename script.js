Hey Shreya... 💌❤️

Happy Birthday, my girl. 🎂🤍

You don't know how special you are to me, Baby. It's your birthday, but I think I'm happier than you are. ❤️ Today, my girl was born—the girl who made my entire life beautiful. I love you so much. Once again, Happy Birthday, Baby. 🫂❤️

Do you remember that day when you corrected my Physics paper and gave me extra marks? 😂❤️ To thank you, I gave you a chewing gum. I still remember that day, and it always makes me smile. Unexpectedly, it became one of the best days of my life.

I know I had a past, about Meha and everything. I'm really sorry for that. But now, I'm all yours, and I promise I'll always stay loyal to you, Baby. ❤️ I want to marry you, Shreya. I'm madly in love with you, and I dream about you every single day. Thank you for everything. 🤍

My everything is you. If it's you, then it's a yes for everything. ❤️ I hope our relationship ends with marriage, two children (our elder one will be a girl and our younger one will be a boy🤭), and the beautiful life we've always dreamed of. Daily hugs, kisses, and growing old together. Even imagining all of that makes me feel shy. 🥹❤️

At the end of this letter, I just want to thank you once again and tell you that I love you so much. One day, I hope we'll become husband and wife, and stay together until we become grandfather and grandmother. ❤️♾️

From your man, ❤️

Vikas ❤️
